SQL is the #1 Essential Skill (7,291 mentions)

SQL dominates demand because every analyst needs to extract, clean, and transform data directly from databases.

Employers clearly view SQL as the non-negotiable foundation for Data Analysts.

Excel Remains Highly Relevant (4,611 mentions)

Despite modern tools, Excel is still a standard for quick analysis, pivot tables, and reporting.

Its popularity shows companies still value analysts who can move between spreadsheets and larger systems.

Python Rising as the Go-To Programming Language (4,330 mentions)

Pythonâ€™s demand nearly equals Excelâ€™s, signaling its importance for automation, advanced analytics, and machine learning basics.

Analysts with Python stand out for being able to go beyond descriptive analysis.

Data Visualization is Critical (Tableau â€“ 3,745 mentions, Power BI â€“ 2,609 mentions)
