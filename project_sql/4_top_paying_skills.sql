‚ö° Quick Insights: Top 25 Highest-Paying Data Analyst Skills
1. Rare/Niche Tools Command Huge Salaries

SVN ($400k) and Solidity ($179k) top the list ‚Äî these are highly specialized and less common in traditional Data Analyst roles.

They likely appear in very specific industries (finance, blockchain, legacy enterprise systems), which explains the extreme salaries.

2. Machine Learning & AI Skills Pay Premium

Keras ($127k), PyTorch ($125k), TensorFlow ($120k), Hugging Face ($123k), and MXNet ($149k) show that ML/AI libraries push salaries above $120k.

Analysts who branch into machine learning engineering or applied AI see higher pay opportunities.

3. Cloud, DevOps & Big Data Stack Are Valuable

Terraform ($146k), VMware ($147k), Kafka ($130k), Airflow ($116k), Cassandra ($118k) all indicate demand for data pipeline, orchestration, and infrastructure skills.

This shows that employers want analysts who can handle modern data ecosystems, not just analyze spreadsheets.

4. Programming & Data Wrangling Tools

GoLang ($155k), Perl ($124k), Scala ($115k) ‚Üí languages outside the typical analyst toolbox, but highly paid when required.

dplyr ($147k) ‚Üí shows R‚Äôs continued importance in certain advanced analytics environments.

5. Collaboration & Workflow Platforms

Tools like GitLab ($134k), Bitbucket ($117k), Atlassian ($118k), Notion ($118k) show that workflow/collaboration tools are valued in high-paying environments.

While not ‚Äúhardcore analytics,‚Äù they reflect skills in team-oriented, large-scale data projects.

üìå Takeaways

Specialization = High Pay ‚Üí Blockchain (Solidity), legacy tools (SVN), and niche frameworks = top salaries, but few roles.

AI/ML Frameworks are Gold ‚Üí Analysts moving toward data science/ML hybrid roles unlock higher pay.

Cloud & Infrastructure Knowledge ‚Üí Big salaries are linked to handling pipelines, data flows, and scalable systems.

Well-rounded Analysts Win ‚Üí Knowing SQL, Python, and Tableau gets you hired, but adding ML or cloud skills gets you paid more.
